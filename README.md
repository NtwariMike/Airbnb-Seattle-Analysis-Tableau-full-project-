## Project overview
My friend wanted to start a house renting business on Airbnb in Seattle, WA. So he asked me to help him know which factors that lead to a successful Airbnb business. I used a data set from Airbnb about all the rental listings detailes for the year of 2016 and analyzed it to help my client make informed decisions.

## Data source

Airbnb 2016 listings: This the primary data set i used which conatined three sub-data
    
    1. Linstings: Contains information about each rental property in seattle
    2. Reviews: Contains all the reviews about rental property per customer
    3. Calendar: Contains the dates by which each rental properties was occupied or not.

## Tools

The main tool i used were 
-  Excel: For analysis
-  Tableau: For building dashboard

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA Invloved exploring the Airbnb 2016 listings to answer the following questions

- Which location within seattle that have high property apriciation and and high ROI
- What is the average rental price in that location
- Which rental property is more popular with many customers
- How many bedrooms should a house have to make it standout
     - Average rental price per bedroom number
     - Total revenues generated per bedroom number

## Building dashboards

1.	Price By Zipcode: The Bar chart summarizes the average rental price by zip code, this will help the user determine which location is expensive
2.	Locate Zipcode on a Map: This graph allows our user to view the locations on the map and see the reviews of each location(Zipcode)
3.	Price per property type: This graphs allows our user to view which type of property that generates more income.
4.	Line chart: This graph shows which compares months according to generated revenues(Which months are better performers)
5.	Income per Bedroom: There are two graphs, one shows the average rental per bedroom category and the second shows the total revenues per bedroom category.

## Results

- Zipcode 98134 is more expensive with average rental price of $207
- The top four popular and expensive property type are boat, condominium, loft and house
- The expensive bedroom number category is 6, but bedroom number of 1 generates more revenues compared to others.
- The months that generates more revenues are from May to July and from October to December

## Recommendations

Based on the results from the analysis, i recommend
1. Buy a condominium property in location with zipcode 98134, with 6 bedrooms. Then rent 1 bedroom each for 4 bedrroms( 1* 4), the other 2 bedrooms left rent them together
2. If you want to live in it, you can do it between Jan to April when customers are few.
